            <p className="p"> Accept your LRAP Award and enroll at Seattle Pacific University in the 2023 - 2024 academic year. After graduating with a bachelor's degree, if you are earning less than $46,000, we will reimburse you for some or all of your covered student loan payments.</p>
            <h1 className="h1">Covered Loans</h1>
            <p className="p">LRAP covers all Federal student and parent PLUS loans, as well as private alternative loans, up to $17,000 per academic year and $70,000 in total. </p>
            <h1 className="h1">After Graduation </h1>
            <p className="p">To qualify for reimbursement, you must obtain employment, working 30+ hours per week across any number of jobs, in any field. It does not even need to be related to your degree. Assistance then continues until you earn more than $46,000 or your loans are fully repaid.</p>
